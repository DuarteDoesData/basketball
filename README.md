What is this? 
A tool to assist with making predictions of matchups during March Madness, specifically the Men’s NCAA Basketball tournament

What are the Data Sources?

Why?
I don’t have a secret for making good picks for my Bracket, but it’s fun to play so I gather some statistics each year to make my picks. This tool automates the data gathering which in the past would have taken more time through clicking around on sports websites.

What tools are used?
- R / RStudio: The R Shiny App enables a UI which anyone can use to see these stats (or if they modify the code then stats of their choosing) to bring all the information you might use to make picks all onto one screen.
